    <string name="splash_permission_write_storage_denied_content">In order to use normally, AppEnv needs reading permission of SD Memory Card.\n\nＱ：Why it needs that permission？\nＡ：For the security of operating system, a permission called 【MODE_WORLD_READABLE】 has been resigned in Android above 7.0. This permission was used to make other processes visit any files that it set, which is also an entrance of configuration to intercept application that AppEnv offered. Because the permission is removed from system, plus I'm a newbie, I grudgingly put configuration files on SD Memory Card so that I let other application to read.\n\nＱ：What will happen if I don't give authority？\nＡ：You can set on 「Use internal space as storage」 in configuration if your system is former than 7.0, then you can use this application normally. On the contrary, I think you couldn't use this normally if version of your operating stsyem is above 7.0 because configuration files can't be saved into internal space.\n\nＱ：But I REALLY hate this permission\nＡ：I answer as author here, this application WON'T add any types of advertisement FOREVER, also, it WON'T generate any messy files in your storage. But there's an exception, statistics we used called 【友盟】, it seems like that it will generate a folder called 【umeng】 of your storage.\n\nＱ：……\nＡ：…………\n</string>
